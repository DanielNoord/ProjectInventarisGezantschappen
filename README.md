### Project Nederlandse Gezantschappen in Turijn en Rome
My task is to translate and correct the inventory of this archive. The code and files in this repo have helped me do this in an organized and consistent manner.
The executable file `Makepdf_nl_NL` can be used to generate a new `Inventaris_nl_NL.pdf` if `Fonds Nederlandse Gezantschappen.docx` is found in the main directory.

### `/python`
Contains self-written code that reads a .docx, extracts the content and writes an XML-file according to EAD specifications.

### `/ead2pdf`
Contains a tool to convert XML-files to PDF-files. See README.md in the folder for its source and specific use.
